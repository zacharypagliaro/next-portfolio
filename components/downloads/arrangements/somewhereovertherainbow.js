    blurb: "There are a lot of guitar arrangements out there covering this song, from [Tommy Emmanuel's classic rendition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cHeNscKZN0) to a wide collection from different jazz guitarists on youtube. While a lot of these versions are certainly nice to listen to and play, they are actually pretty advanced pieces. The arrangement here is made for beginners who are looking to challenge themselves with a simple example of fingerstyle technique and working with indepedent basslines.",
