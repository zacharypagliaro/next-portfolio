    blurb: "It was only recently that I realized a lot of the incidental music from the show is actually based off of the original works created for the games. It's really impressive how this game has evolved over the years, and the music has consistently been a vital part of the whole franchise. It speaks to the strength of the compositions, no matter how simple - they really inspire joy, mystery, tranquility and danger all somehow simultaneously.",
